    biography: |
      This is the central figure of the family tree, the one whose life story
      spans countless pages and generations of memory. Born in a small village
      at the turn of the century, they witnessed the rise and fall of empires,
      the birth of new technologies, and the transformation of the world.

      Their early years were marked by hardship and determination. Through
      sheer willpower and an unwavering belief in the goodness of humanity,
      they overcame obstacles that would have broken lesser spirits. Every
      challenge became a stepping stone, every setback a lesson learned.

      The family they built became their greatest legacy. Children, grandchildren,
      great-grandchildren - each carrying forward the values instilled in them
      by this remarkable individual. Stories of their wisdom are still told
      around dinner tables, their sayings have become family proverbs.

      In their twilight years, they became a beacon of hope for all who knew
      them. Their garden flourished, their door was always open, and their
      heart remained as warm as the summer sun. When they finally departed
      this world, they left behind not just a family, but a legacy that would
      echo through the generations.
